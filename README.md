# Plague VS. Drug!

## Introduction

This is a simple toy model to demostrate and visualize the dynamic scences of the plague outbreak and the drug effect.
You can also simulate more scences and find more fun by tuning the parameters yourself!

## Install Octave

To run the program, you need MATLAB/Octave installed in your environment, and personally I'll recommend Octave since it's open-source and nearly the same as MATLAB!
It's very easy to install Octave for Mac:
```
$ brew install octave
```
... and for Linux:
```
$ sudo apt install octave
```

## Run

Once you have Octave installed in your environment, change the directory to this program with `cd`:
```
$ cd plague_model/
```
then open Octave and execute the `main.m` under its prompt:
```
$ octave
octave:1> main
```
All done! You should now see the example figure with definite parameters I set in the `main.m`.
Feel free to try different parameters. Have fun~ :smile:
